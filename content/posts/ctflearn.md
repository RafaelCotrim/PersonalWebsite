# Time for yet another side project!


I have been experimenting with a lot o new technologies recently. I have dipped my toes in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), [MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), and many others. With some, like Rust, I had a very good time with and intend to continue learning. Others didn't click with me, but the experience still counts. Still, I have never gotten into anything cybersecurity-related outside of what I learned at school or what I use when developing web applications. So, after watching [way too many videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w) about the topic, I decided to try something out. 

A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a model often used in cybersecurity competitions. Essentially, you are given a system or setup (most often a server) that you must exploit to acquire a special string, the flag. The flag proves that you have successfully completed the challenge and that you can receive the respective points/prize. CTFs gamefy hacking and incentivize people to learn many technologies in order to win. Both depth and breadth of knowledge are required to win the hardest ones... Which is exactly why I'm not going anywhere near them. For now...

Seriously, have you ever looked at the write-ups where people talk about how they solved the problems? It is pure [black magic!](https://github.com/orgs/ctfs/repositories) While I know more about cybersecurity than the average person by the virtue of being a programmer, I would be completely lost if thrown into an actual CTF. First, I need to learn the basics until I (hopefully) can participate in something more substantial. This is where CTFLearn comes in.

As the name suggests, [CTFLearn](https://ctflearn.com/) is a platform for learning the skills necessary to solve CTFs. It first introduces various topics in simple puzzles and slowly increases the difficulty. It is an amazing resource for beginners and the community that has grown around it can help people out when they are completely stuck and have no idea where to go.

## Objectives

The point of this exercise is to learn as much as I can about the different topics involved in CTFs. To that end, I'll write blog posts about each challenge, show how I've solved it, and a bit more background information. These blog posts will serve as an archive that I can check later when I encounter similar topics and as a way to encourage me to do a bit more reading on each topic.

I'll also try not to use tools like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), a Swiss army knife for competitions like these. While CyberChef is a wonderful tool, I want to force myself to use "lower-level" solutions such as bash utilities for simpler things and code I have written myself. This way I'll have to develop a deeper understanding of each topic. This will help me actually remember how to use some of Linux's command-line tools instead of needing to google it every time.

However, I still reserve my right to "cheat" this rule in case I already feel very conformable with a topic or it would be stupidly complex/infeasible to build my own solution. My time is finite and getting stuck on stuff like this is a great way to lose motivation.
