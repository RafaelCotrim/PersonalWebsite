# Hello!

I'm Rafael Cotrim, and this is my blog/archive. I'm a Brazilian software developer, but I'm currently living in Portugal. Most of my experience is in web development with C# and .NET, but I'm always experimenting with new things.

Stick around for posts about random things I'm learning and occasionally other topics.

Oh, and I have published a [scientistic article](https://astesj.com/v06/i04/p38/)! It is an energy consumption analysis of MAC protocols used in wireless sensor networks. Maybe I'll write a post about how I built those simulations someday, but I'm kind of fed up with OMNeT++ at the moment... C++, it always surprises me how you are consistently able to fry my brain...
